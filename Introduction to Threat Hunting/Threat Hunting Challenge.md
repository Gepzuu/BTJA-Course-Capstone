# Challenge Scenario:
<div align="justify">
You are a Junior Threat Hunter working for an organisation. Your Threat Intelligence team has obtained two malware samples, but they’re too busy dealing with a data breach dump that includes employee credentials, so you’ll need to hunt for any presence of the malware in any systems. As you’re new to the role, the Senior Threat Hunter is using advanced tools to assess all systems company-wide, but he has given you permission to run a live hunt on one system. A disk image was taken, as the system is in a remote office. You have been told to gather your own IOCs from two malware samples, and conduct a hunt on the files using Mandiant IOC Editor and Mandiant Redline. You are to report on the findings generated by the IOC Reports.


## Questions:
1. How many pieces of malware were detected using IOCs generated from the two samples?
2. What is the file name beginning with \"w\"?
3. Is there malware in the location "/DaveS/Pictures"?
4. Which MD5 hash appears in two different files?
