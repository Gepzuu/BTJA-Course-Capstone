# Challenge Description:
<div align="justify">
You are looking to move into a Vulnerability Analyst position within the security team, but first you have to prove your skills. You have been asked to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the intentionally vulnerable system, Metasploitable 2. You are required to work individually to conduct a scan of the system using Nessus (preferably within Kali Linux), you will host both systems yourself in virtual machines. You have been given a report template, which you must fill out completely and submit to be considered for the new role. Download the template to your local machine, conduct the scan, and fill out the questions, before uploading your report in the next section.

## Overview:
The scan results show that the system has many security problems. We found 115 issues that need to be fixed. The system is at risk because of old software, misconfigured services, and weak passwords. These problems could let attackers access the system without permission, steal important data, or cause problems with how the system works.

## Top 5 Most Serious Security Issues (In priority order - most important first):
1. Unpatched Apache Struts Vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially leading to a complete system compromise. If exploited, an attacker could gain access to sensitive data, disrupt system operations, or use the system as a launchpad for further attacks.

2. Weak SSH Password (CVE-2019-6111) The system uses a weak SSH password, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system, steal sensitive data, or disrupt system operations.

3. Outdated OpenSSL Version (CVE-2016-2107) The system uses an outdated version of OpenSSL, which is vulnerable to various attacks, including the DROWN attack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to intercept and decrypt sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

4. Unconfigured FTP Server (CVE-2011-2523) The system has an unconfigured FTP server, which allows anonymous access to the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious files, steal sensitive data, or disrupt system operations.

5. Missing Windows Security Updates (CVE-2020-0688) The system is missing critical Windows security updates, making it vulnerable to various attacks, including remote code execution and privilege escalation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system, steal sensitive data, or disrupt system operations.


## Top 5 - Remediations (In priority order - most important first):
1. Patch the Apache Struts Vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638): Immediately apply the patch to fix the Apache Struts vulnerability to prevent remote code execution and potential system compromise.

2. Change the Weak SSH Password (CVE-2019-6111): Change the weak SSH password to a strong and unique password to prevent brute-force attacks and unauthorized access to the system.

3. Update OpenSSL to the Latest Version (CVE-2016-2107): Update OpenSSL to the latest version to prevent vulnerabilities such as the DROWN attack and ensure secure encryption of sensitive data.

4. Configure the FTP Server (CVE-2011-2523): Configure the FTP server to disable anonymous access and ensure secure file transfers to prevent unauthorized access and data theft.

5. Apply Missing Windows Security Updates (CVE-2020-0688): Apply the missing Windows security updates to prevent remote code execution, privilege escalation, and other attacks that could compromise the system.
