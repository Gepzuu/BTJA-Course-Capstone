<div align="justify">
The SOC has received an anonymous report that a user is potentially exfiltrating data from the company. An image of the userâ€™s hard drive has been taken, and you are responsible for analyzing the contents of a perfect copy to find any evidence of malicious activity. Using your newly developed skills, search through the folders and files using techniques to uncover 4 pieces of hidden information (each piece of evidence will contain the string {1 of 4} or similar). You will be tested on your ability to discover this information using all of the techniques taught in this course; Linux CLI navigation, identifying incorrect file extensions, identifying hidden files/folders, steganography, and password cracking.
