# Challenge Scenario:
<div align="justify">
Hi Investigator, we need you...

Last month we were informed about a huge drug trafficking network that was taking place in the UK through the TOR network, in response to this situation we set to work and managed to dismantle their main TOR marketplace to stop drugs reaching the streets of the UK. However, we were informed that one of the creators of this network managed to evade us and is now continuing to carry out this type of activity. This is where you come in. We think we have found the site that this individual uses to "tell their stories" regarding criminal activity.

We need you to find evidence that will allow us to identify this subject, relate it to the drug trafficking crimes, and bring them to justice. We know this is a difficult task, but we are confident in your abilities and we are sure that you will succeed.

1] Gain access to the site (We're sure there's some way for users to gain valid credentials fairly easily). <br>
2] Find evidence that the individual is involved in drug trafficking.<br>
3] Find any information about the next shipment that is coming in, so we can seize it.<br>
